# Project-9

# Fraud detection
### Model used -Random forest


# Project objective:
Develop a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm for fraud detection. The dataset includes features such as Undergrad, Marital Status, Taxable Income, City Population, Work Experience, and Urban. The goal is to identify patterns indicative of fraud based on these features.

# Dataset:
  Columns :
Undergrad

Marital Status

Taxable Income

City Population

Work Experience

Urban

# Methodology :
### 1. Requirements

Python

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Data Overview:

Examined the structure of the dataset.
Reviewed summary statistics for key variables.

#### Feature Distribution:

Analyzed the distribution of each feature, including categorical features like Undergrad, Marital Status, and Urban.

#### Taxable Income Insights:

Investigated the distribution of taxable income and identified any patterns or anomalies.


### 3. Feature Selection:

Selected features such as Undergrad, Marital Status, Taxable Income, City Population, Work Experience, and Urban.

### 4. Model Selection:

Utilized the Random Forest algorithm for fraud detection.

Random Forest is robust and effective for handling complex relationships and avoiding overfitting.

### 5. Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained the Random Forest model on the training data.

### 6. Model Evaluation:

Assessed the model's performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
